    <h1>My First HTML Page</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Kossi Fioklou and I'm learning HTML as a way to pursue a career in frontend development. 
         I'm driven to learn HTML because of the endless possibilities it offers 
         for creating engaging, dynamic websites. I'm eager to learn more and apply 
         what I learn to create visually appealing and functionally effective websites. 
         I'm motivated to make an impact in the world of web development, 
         and I believe that understanding HTML 
        is the foundation to making that happen.</p>
    <h2>My Motivation</h2>
    <p>I'm motivated to learn HTML because I want to gain a deeper
       understanding of how websites are created. HTML is the foundation 
       of the internet, and I'm eager to learn the basics of web development and design.
       By understanding HTML, I can create beautiful and functional websites, 
       and become a more effective web designer. Additionally, I'm interested
       in learning how to make my websites more interactive by adding audio, video, 
       and animation. HTML is an incredibly useful skill and I'm excited to learn it!
